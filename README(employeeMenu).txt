Instructions for testing...

    in the csv file you will find the data for several different users. This includes their username in collumn
    one, their password in collumn two, and their permissions status in collumn three.

    -Admins can access all applications
    -Users can only access the Time Report, IT Helpdesk, and Accounting apps
    -guests can only access the Time Report and IT Helpdesk

    Login as each of these users to test the different access levels by trying to run each program as each user.
    These are the passwords for the first three users
    #userA - password - admin
    #userB - animal123 - user
    #userC - Cookie - guest

    feel free to register a new user or two to see how my program can...
        -verify that a password is strong enough
        -generate a strong password
        -handle input validation
    Also check my csv to see that all the passwords are encrypted and are unreadable within the csv.
